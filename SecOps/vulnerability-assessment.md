# Vulnerability Assessment Report
**Date:** 1st January 20XX

## System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

## Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

## Purpose
The purpose of this vulnerability assessment is to evaluate the security risks associated with the publicly accessible database server that stores sensitive business and customer information. Because the database supports core business operations such as customer data queries and sales activities, any compromise could result in financial loss, reputational damage, or legal consequences. Securing the data on the server is crucial to maintaining customer trust, ensuring regulatory compliance, and protecting proprietary information. This assessment also helps identify weaknesses that could lead to service disruption if the server were disabled or attacked, allowing the organization to apply appropriate security controls to reduce risk.

## Risk Assessment

| Threat Source | Threat Event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk Score |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Competitor | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 1 | 3 | 3 |
| Malicious software | Alter/Delete critical information | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| Faulty power supplies | Disrupt mission-critical operations | 2 | 3 | 6 |

## Approach
This qualitative vulnerability assessment focuses on identifying the most significant threats to the publicly accessible database server based on likelihood and potential business impact. The selected threat sources; unauthorized data exfiltration, malicious software, and infrastructure failure, were chosen because they represent realistic and high impact risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical business data. Each threat was evaluated using professional judgment and industry best practices to estimate severity and likelihood. This approach helps prioritize risks that could most disrupt operations, compromise sensitive information, or cause financial and reputational harm to the organization.

## Remediation Strategy
To reduce the risks identified in this assessment, the database server should be removed from public access and placed behind a firewall with strict network access controls. Access should be limited to authorized employees using secure authentication methods such as role-based access control and multi-factor authentication. Regular patching of the operating system and database software should be enforced to protect against known vulnerabilities and malicious software. Additionally, implementing routine data backups, system monitoring, and intrusion detection will help ensure business continuity and enable rapid response to security incidents.
