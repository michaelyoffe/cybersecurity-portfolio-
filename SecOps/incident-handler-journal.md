# Incident Handler's Journal

## Entry 1: 

**Date:** January 13, 2026

**Description:** Documenting a ransomware attack at a small U.S. healthcare clinic

**Tool Used:** none.

**The 5 W's:**
* **Who:** Organized group of unethical hackers.
* **What:** Ransomware security incident; files encrypted with a ransom demand.
* **When:** Tuesday morning, approximately 9:00 a.m.
* **Where:** Small U.S. healthcare clinic.
* **Why:** The incident happened because an organized group of unethical hackers gained unauthorized access to the companies systems using a phishing attack that deployed ransomware. This appears to be a financial motive since a ransom note was left stating that the company's files were encrypted and demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. 

**Additional Notes:** 
* This is a spear phishing attack using ransomware
* What security measures can the company take to prevent this incident from reoccurring?

## Entry 2: 

**Date:** January 15, 2026

**Description:** Analyzing a packet capture file

**Tool Used:** For this activity, I used Wireshark to examine a packet capture file. Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer with a graphical user interface that enables detailed inspection of network traffic. In cybersecurity, Wireshark is valuable because it allows security analysts to capture and analyze network communications, which can aid in identifying and investigating malicious activity.

**The 5 W's:**
* **Who:** N/A
* **What:** N/A
* **When:** NA
* **Where:** N/A
* **Why:** N/A

**Additional Notes:** I had no prior experience using Wireshark, so I was eager to start this exercise and analyze a packet capture file. Initially, the interface felt overwhelming, but it quickly became clear why Wireshark is such a powerful tool for analyzing and understanding network traffic.

## Entry 3: 

**Date:** January 15, 2026

**Description:** Capturing my first packet

**Tool Used:** For this activity, I used tcpdump to capture and analyze network traffic. Tcpdump is a command-line network protocol analyzer that enables security analysts to monitor, filter, and examine network traffic. Like Wireshark, tcpdump is a valuable cybersecurity tool for identifying and investigating network activity.

**The 5 W's:**
* **Who:** N/A
* **What:** N/A
* **When:** N/A
* **Where:** N/A
* **Why:** N/A

**Additional Notes:** Since I am still learning how to use the command-line interface, capturing and filtering network traffic presented some challenges. I ran into a few issues due to using incorrect commands, but by carefully following the instructions and revisiting certain steps, I was ultimately able to complete the activity and successfully capture network traffic.

## Entry 4: 

**Date:** January 17, 2026

**Description:** Investigating a suspicious file hash

**Tool Used:** For this activity, I used VirusTotal, an investigative tool that analyzes files and URLs for malicious content such as viruses, worms, and trojans. VirusTotal is particularly useful for quickly determining whether an indicator of compromise—such as a file or website—has been identified as malicious by members of the cybersecurity community. In this exercise, I used VirusTotal to examine a file hash that had been reported as malicious.
This incident took place during the Detection and Analysis phase. The scenario positioned me as a SOC security analyst tasked with investigating a suspicious file hash. After the file was flagged by existing security controls, I conducted further analysis to determine whether the alert represented a legitimate threat.

**The 5 W's:**
* **Who:** An unknown malicious attacker  
* **What:** An email sent to an employee contained a malicious file attachment with the SHA-256 file hash of 54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b
* **When:**  At 1:20 p.m., an alert was sent to the organization's SOC after theintrusion detection system detected the file
* **Where:** An employee's computer at a financial services company.
* **Why:** At 1:20 p.m., an alert was sent to the organization's SOC after the intrusion detection system detected the file
  
**Additional Notes:** How can similar incidents be prevented in the future? Should enhanced security awareness training be implemented to ensure employees are more cautious about the links and files they interact with?
